# Capstone-Project-Level-2

Capstone Project – Level 2

Overview For your capstone project, you will apply all the concepts and skills learned throughout this level to build a functional and interactive website. You have two options:

Create a new website from scratch
Enhance and expand upon your Level 1 Capstone Project
Regardless of your choice, your project must meet the mandatory requirements outlined below.

Project Requirements

General Structure
Your website must have at least three (3) HTML pages, which should be navigable via a Bootstrap Navbar.
The content should be structured using HTML5 semantic elements (e.g., , , , ).
Implement accessibility best practices, including ARIA labels and alt text for images.
Bootstrap Components Your project must make use of the following Bootstrap components:
Cards – Used to display dynamic content (e.g., user input or API data).
Spinners – Displayed while waiting for API responses or processing form submissions.
Badges – Used to highlight specific content (e.g., user role, notification count).
Rows and Columns – Implement a responsive grid layout with Bootstrap’s row/col system.
Alerts – Provide feedback messages (success, error, warnings, etc.).
Buttons – Styled using Bootstrap with interactive behaviors (e.g., triggering a function).
Forms & User Interaction
Your project must include a form with at least:

Input fields (text, number, email, etc.)
Dropdown/select options
A checkbox and radio buttons
A submit button
The form must have client-side validation with appropriate feedback messages using Bootstrap styles (e.g., .is-invalid, .valid-feedback).

The form submission should modify the page dynamically, for example:

Displaying user input inside a Bootstrap Card or Table.
Rendering a new HTML element based on the input data.
Tables
Include at least one table with meaningful data.
The table should be styled with Bootstrap classes (.table, .table-striped, etc.).
API Calls
Your project must fetch and display data from two (2) external APIs using:

fetch api
async and await
The API responses should be used meaningfully, such as:

Displaying fetched data inside a table or card.
Updating part of the UI based on user interactions.
6. JavaScript (DOM Manipulation) Your project must include JavaScript-based interactivity, such as:

Creating or removing elements dynamically.
Adding or removing classes from elements.
Appending child elements to a container.
Adding an event listener to a button to trigger a function.
7. Accessibility & Preformatted Text

Ensure all images have alt text.
Include ARIA attributes where necessary.
Display an example of preformatted text using the tag.
Maximizing Efficiency in Your Capstone Project As you work on your capstone project, remember that many of the requirements can be completed simultaneously. Instead of treating each item as an isolated task, think strategically about how you can combine multiple requirements into a single feature to save time and create a more cohesive project.

Examples of Combining Requirements Efficiently:

Form + Table + JavaScript DOM Manipulation

Your project requires a form where users can input data.
Instead of just displaying the submitted data as plain text, you can use JavaScript to dynamically generate a Bootstrap table and render the user’s input inside it.
This approach checks off multiple requirements at once:
Forms with validation and feedback
JavaScript for altering the DOM (creating elements, appending children)
Displaying user input dynamically
Bootstrap Cards + API Calls

You need to fetch and display data from two external APIs. Instead of just printing raw JSON, consider displaying API data inside Bootstrap cards to make it visually appealing.
This approach covers:
API calls using axios, async, and await
Bootstrap components (Cards, Spinners for loading states)
Dynamic content rendering
Final Presentation Requirement At the end of the project, you will be required to present your website in a walkthrough session. During this presentation, you will:

Demonstrate your website’s functionality – Show how each feature works and how it meets the project requirements.
Explain parts of your code – Be prepared to walk me through specific sections of your code, including how you structured your JavaScript, handled API calls, and applied Bootstrap components.
Highlight how you combined multiple requirements – Show where you efficiently merged different requirements into a single feature to maximize productivity.
This presentation is an opportunity to showcase not just your final product but also your understanding of the code and problem-solving approach.

Plan ahead, be strategic, and build efficiently!
